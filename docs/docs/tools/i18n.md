!!! tip "xtyle.i18n"

    The **i18n (internationalization)** allows you to handle translations in your project effectively. With **`xtyle.translations`**, you can register translation object, and later, you can access those translations using **`xtyle.i18n`**.

## **Register** Translations

To set up translations, you need to use the **`xtyle.translations`** method. It takes an object as input.

```js
/* Set Translations */
xtyle.translations({
  fr: {
    greetings: {
      hello: "Bonjour!",
    },
  },
});
```

In this example, we're registering a single translation for the French language. You can add more translations for different languages by extending the **`xtyle.translations`** object with additional language codes and their respective translations.

## **Access** Translations

The **`xtyle.i18n`** method takes a single argument, which is a dot-separated string representing the path to the translation you want to retrieve.

The format of the string is **`path_to.translation_key`**.

Here's an example of how to use **`xtyle.i18n`** to retrieve the French greeting we registered earlier:

```js
/* Preview */
console.log("i18n: ", xtyle.i18n("fr.greetings.hello"));
```

In this case, the output will be:

```
i18n: Bonjour!
```

By using `xtyle.i18n`, you can easily access the translations you registered globally throughout your project and display content in different languages based on the user's preference or the context of your application.
